# SustainabilityNC

## Competitions
- [Ready Set App](https://readysetapp.devpost.com/)
- [Code for Congress](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/)
- [AppInventor App of the Month](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/app-month-gallery)


## Plan/Proposal
- **Purpose:** create an Android app with a focus on sustainability and climate change in order to educate people about sustainability and empower them to take steps for change

- **Tools:** if possible, building from scratch with Java or Android Studio; use [MIT AppInventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) for prototyping (and as a backup if Java doesn't work/takes too long)

- **Target Audience:** average North Carolinians, ages 8+    
    
## Timeline (tentative)
*in progress*
- [x] recruit members (must have: 3 people (at most 4), diversity; preferably include environmentalists, ppl with coding knowledge, and artists for product design; also find an advisor) | by end of November

*planned*
- [ ] brainstorming stage (name, color schemes, loading screens, etc, come up with team roles and titles lol) | in first week of Dec
- [ ] research and learn to code | December
- [ ] create a prototype and add functionality to the web app | January
- [ ] design and build the app | February
- [ ] assess needs, testing | end of February
- [ ] prepare for competitions and such | March

*extras*
- [ ] multi-language support (most likely Spanish, French, and trad. Chinese first)
- [ ] make it easily adaptable for other regions; format this as a template
- [ ] create a kids corner, for kids from ages 10 and under
- [ ] ~~(pass this to environmental club as a project when done -- boycotting the seven existing code clubs bc we're cool like that)~~

# SustainabilityNC

- **Features:**
    - section on calculating family carbon emissions (something like [this](https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/))
    - section on educating to reduce individual carbon emissions (including recycling, composting, choosing electrical vehicles, considering greener energy sources)
    - section on corporations and their impact; connect it to the next section (also mention economics)
    - section on connecting user to policymakers to lobby for climate change policy (so for example, choose a location, then list out representatives in local/state/national legislature with contact information, preferred pronouns, background, etc)
    - section on educating people on what policies to lobby for in contacting policymakers
    - section on more recommended resources (documentaries, books, etc) to explore
    - section on how to cope w the idea of climate change and destroying the planet
    - correction form option available
- **Motivation:** A lot of resources on climate change today are focused on *convincing* people that climate change exists. However, not very many resources are provided to help people who want to be able to make a difference. SustainabilityNC is meant to make climate change and sustainability less overwhelming to think about for the average person, while attempting to use evidence to explain to deniers why they should pay attention to sustainability.
